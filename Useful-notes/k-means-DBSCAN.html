<h1>K-Means</h1>
<p>
    K-Means is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together into clusters.
    It is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm.
</p>
<p>
    The algorithm works by randomly selecting K initial centroids, and then assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.
    Then it recalculates the centroids based on the mean of the data points in each cluster.
    This process is repeated until the centroids no longer change.
</p>
<p>
    The algorithm is sensitive to the initial centroids, so it is important to choose them wisely.
</p>

<h1>K-Means++</h1>
<p>
    K-Means++ is a variant of the K-Means algorithm that selects the initial centroids in a way that is more likely to result in a good clustering.
    The algorithm works by randomly selecting a data point as a seed, and then expanding the cluster by adding data points that are within a certain distance of the seed.
    This process is repeated until all data points are assigned to a cluster.
</p>

<h1>DBSCAN</h1>
<p>
    DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together into clusters.
    It is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm.
    It is based on the idea of density-based clustering, where a cluster is a region of high density of data points.
    The algorithm works by randomly selecting a data point as a seed, and then expanding the cluster by adding data points that are within a certain distance of the seed.
    This process is repeated until all data points are assigned to a cluster.
</p>
<p>
    The algorithm is sensitive to the initial seed, so it is important to choose it wisely.
    It cannot predict the cluster of a new data point, it can only assign it to a cluster.
