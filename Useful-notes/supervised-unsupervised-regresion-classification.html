<h1>Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning</h1>

<p>
    Given a set of points X associated with a set of outcomes Y, we want to build a model that can predict the outcome for a new input.
    
    Based on the type of the prediction we want to make, we can classify the problem into two types:
    <ul>
        <li>Classification</li>
        <li>Regression</li>
    </ul>

    A classification problem is a problem where the outcome is a categorical variable.
    For example, if we want to predict the outcome of a coin toss, the outcome is a categorical variable because it can be either heads or tails.
    A regression problem is a problem where the outcome is a continuous variable.
    For example, if we want to predict the price of a house, the outcome is a continuous variable because it can be any value between a minimum and a maximum.

    There are also another two types of models, based on what they learn from the data
    <ul>
        <li>
            Discriminative models
            <ul>
                <li>Learn the decision boundary between the classes, learns P(y|x)</li>
                <li>Example: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks with softmax output layer, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM as concepts)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Generative models
            <ul>
                <li>It learns how the data is generated, P(x|y). Sometimes based on the knowledge of P(y|x) the model deduces P(x|y)</li>
                <li>It learns probability distributions of the data</li>
                <li>Example: GANs, LLMs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    A discriminative model is a model that

    Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset.
    The model is trained to find patterns in the data.
