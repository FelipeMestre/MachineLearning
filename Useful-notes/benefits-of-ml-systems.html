    <p>
        ML systems are able to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
        They are able to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.
        They are able to handle large amounts of data and complex relationships between variables.
        They are able to learn from data in a way that is not possible for humans.

    <ul>
        <li>Humans can learn from the patterns gathered by the model</li>
        <li>They can tacke problems that are not possible to solve with traditional algorithms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cases of Machine Learning Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them</li>
        <li>Detecting tumors in brain scans</li>
        <li>Automatically classifying news articles</li>
        <li>Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums</li>
        <li>Summarizing long documents automatically</li>
        <li>Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant</li>
        <li>Forecasting your company’s revenue next year, based on many performance metrics</li>
        <li>Making your app react to voice commands</li>
        <li>Detecting credit card fraud</li>
        <li>Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a
            different marketing strategy for each segment</li>
        <li>Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful
            diagram</li>

        <li>Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past
            purchases</li>
        <li>Building an intelligent bot for a game</li>
    </ul>
