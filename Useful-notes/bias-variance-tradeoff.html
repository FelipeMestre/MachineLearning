    Bias vs Variance
</h1>

<p>
    It is a way to decompose the models generalization error in three parts: bias², variance, and irreducible noise.
    Bias is how far the model is from the true function (systematic error). Another way to describe it is the errors that occur due to wrong
    assumptions about the data, like asuming it is a linear relationship when it is a quadratic one. A high bias model will be underfitting.
</p>

<p>
    Variance is how much the model variates its answers when trained on different datasets from the same distribution (instability). For example, 
    a model with many degrees of freedom will have a high variance and thus overfit the training data.
</p>

<p>
    The irreductible noise is given by the data, it cannot be reduced by the model, the only way to reduce is to get cleaner data, fix the sources
    such as broken sensors, or detect and remove outliers.
</p>

<p>
    Increasing a model complexity will increase its variance and decrease its bias, conversely, decreasing the complexity will increase the bias
    and decrease the variance which is called the bias-variance trade-off.
